                        <p>The Secure Data Commons is an online analytic portal for transportation researchers. On this
                            portal, researchers can take advantage of pre-established programming environments to access
                            and analyze a growing set of transportation-related data sets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The SDC platform provides a collaborative environment for traffic engineers, researchers,
                            data scientists and anyone who is interested in carrying out research and analysis on
                            different datasets related to traffic, weather, crashes etc.

                        <h4>3) What is SDC Datasets?</h4>
                        <p>The dataset types are described as follows:</p>
                        <span>
                            <li class="push-top-30"><b>Raw datasets</b></li>
                            <p>The data stored in its native or original format are referred to as Raw datasets. These datasets could be in structured (databases, logs, financial data etc), semi-structured (HTML, XML, RDF, CSV) and un-structured (images, PDF, docs). This data is unaltered and stored in as-is format. The data can be received through continuous streaming sources (APIs, sensors) or one-time load from external sources</p>
                            <li class="push-top-30"><b>Curated datasets</b></li>
                            <p>Data curation is a process of integrating the raw data collected from various sources, annotating the data and presenting it in such a way that the value of the data is maintained overtime and the data remains available for reuse and preservation. Curated datasets enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add value and provide for re-use over time, for researchers and data scientists. The curation process includes data transformations from unstructured and semi structured formats to a structured format, deduplication of data, data obfuscation, data cleansing etc thus providing high quality of data for researchers to create meaningful insights</p>
                            <li class="push-top-30"><b>Published datasets</b></li>
                            <p>Published datasets are created by researchers to disclose their research for other users to verify and reuse them beyond the original purpose for which they were collected. Published datasets are a result of combining analysis on curated datasets available in SDC platform along with other datasets or algorithms that is owned/created by a researcher or data scientist</p>
