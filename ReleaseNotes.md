* August 8, 2019. SDC sdc-dot-webportal Release 2.1 - [Add DHS HSTS Module](webportal-hsts/index.js)
    - Enabled HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy to ensure data is encrypted before it is sent, making it impossible for attackers to read or modify the data in transit to the authenticated server. HSTS protects against HTTP downgrade attacks (SSL stripping attacks) by requiring all traffic to use HTTPS, and rewrites requests that do not point to encrypted sources.
